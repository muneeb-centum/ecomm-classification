Downtube/Bike1.com introduces our folding bike & kids bike models
Folding bikes are adaptable, resourceful and versatile. As the name implies, you can fold them and easily take them on the train, bus and inside of a vehicle. When you open them up, they are amazingly agile and swift on the roadways! At Downtube, you will find several new folding bike models to choose from. All of our folding bikes will give you the lifestyle of freedom, providing transportation solutions that are affordable, practical and fun.
  The Design Phase
For years, the designers have perfected the Downtube Folding Bikes to provide the highest quality that customers deserve. Since late 1990s to 2003, we have been fortunate to have professional designers at an overseas high end factory dedicating their time and passion to creating this wonder bike.
  In 2003, we decided to introduce the Downtube VI folding bicycle on the market and to the public. It was a hit! So, in 2005, we did the same thing with our 9 FS full suspension folding bike, which became a best seller and favorite!
  In early 2015, we introduced two new Downtube Folding bike models that the public have also fallen in love with. These new models feature the Gates Carbon belt drives with Shimano Nexus internal hubs. In 2017 we continued the evolution by moving up to Shimano Alfine 11 sp hubs with the Gates CDX belt drives. Supplies are limited, make sure to get one before they are gone.

At Downtube, we are in the business of helping people like you to unfold new journeys at home and abroad by sharing our folding bikes. We are excited about the prospect of helping you to fulfill your passion for adventure.
