Who Are We?
Kenco the work and play outfitter, is a locally owned and operated family business. Kenco's doors first opened in 1982 on Rock City Road in Woodstock, NY, and was committed to the proposition that hard workers needed clothing and gear to match their ambition. Since then we have moved to Hurley Mountain rd, off of route 28, but we have applied the same principle and grown to include clothing and footwear for working, outdoor adventure, and casual Catskill living. Kenco is the place to go to for knowledge and gear in the sports of kayaking and boating, camping and hiking, archery, snowboarding, and fly fishing. All of our products are chosen by our excellent staff who, unlike in most big box stores, actually spend time in the outdoors. Always friendly, and decidedly non corporate, you are always welcome.
