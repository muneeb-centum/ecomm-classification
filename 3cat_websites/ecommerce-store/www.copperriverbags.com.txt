  Thomas A. Verified Buyer 
I am very impressed with the workmanship, quality of leather and design of my Voyager bag.I also purchased the organizer which adds a little structure and organization without taking up no room or added weight at all. I love this bag. When I can I will be purchasing some other accessories and messenger bags for my kids.

Just returned from two weeks traversing Scotland and my bag made the trip so much easier. I carried a DSLR and long lens with a smattering of support gear, and still had plenty of room for "purse-type" items, phone, Itinerary and guidebooks, snacks, and lots more. Carrying it cross
body was extremely comfortable, and (tho never a slave to fashion), I even got some complements on the bag. Would highly recommend. Mine is just getting broken in and I can look forward to many years of enjoyment. BTW, fits under the airline seat when fully packed.
