80% Arms sells AR-15 and .308 80% Lower Receivers, 80% Lower Jigs, and other accessories for legal DIY home building of firearms, with no FFL required. We adhere to the highest standards of precision 5-axis CNC manufacturing for all our .308 and AR-15 lower receivers, using premium US made billet aluminum alloys. No one sells AR-15 80% Lowers with tighter tolerances. We also offer our patented AR-15 and .308 Easy Jig which is the first jig that makes it ridiculously easy for a non-machinist to finish their 80% lower in under 1 hour with no drill press required.
