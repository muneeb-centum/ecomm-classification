What Is Cricut Vinyl?
Vinyl is a highly versatile PVC film product that is well suited to crafting, decorating, and scrap booking.  This vinyl film has a pressure sensitive adhesive layer on the back that will allow it to adhere to many surfaces from smooth to semi rough.
Expressions Vinyl currently carries two different types of vinyl.  The first which we call “Cricut Vinyl” is made by Oracal.  This particular vinyl is Oracal 631 and is the exact same product Provo Craft sells for their popular Cricut machines.  This Cricut vinyl is compatible with any electronic craft cutter, not just the Cricut.  We also carry a product we call “Outdoor Cricut Vinyl”.  This product is Oracal 651 and is similar to the “Cricut Vinyl”, but is better suited for outdoor applications.
Our vinyl is available in thirty colors and we are so confident you will love our vinyl we stand behind it with a full satisfaction guarantee.  We also want to make sure you know how to use your Cricut vinyl, we have How-To Videos.  We also have Project Ideas to make sure you never run out of ideas for your Cricut vinyl.
Vinyl For Cricut
We sell a few different types of vinyl for Cricut. First there is "Cricut Vinyl" which is Oracal 631. This is the same stuff that Provo Craft sells. We also have "Outdoor Cricut Vinyl" which is Oracal 651. This is similar to the "Cricut Vinyl", but has a gloss finish and a more aggressive adhesive.
Then there is heat transfer vinyl for Cricut. This is used for making vinyl graphics that transfer onto fabric.
Lastly is our newwest vinyl. We now have patterned vinyl, such as zebra pring, houndstooth, damask, and polka dot.
