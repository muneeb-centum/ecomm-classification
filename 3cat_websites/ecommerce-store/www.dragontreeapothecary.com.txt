“Dragontree Apothecary believes in Inside+Out body care that’s wholesome and effective."
As spa owners and health care practitioners we know the value of high quality ingredients, intentionally crafted formulations, and therapeutic products. We’ve been working with plant and mineral medicines for over two decades, playing with their chemical compounds and energetics to achieve optimal results.
All our Dragontree Apothecary offerings are handcrafted with care in Portland, Oregon. These luxurious, all-natural products will appeal to your senses, nourish your body, and you become your most vibrant, centered, and peaceful self. Come behind the scenes of our Apothecary and see for yourself how our team puts love and care into each and every bottle, soap, and scrub.
