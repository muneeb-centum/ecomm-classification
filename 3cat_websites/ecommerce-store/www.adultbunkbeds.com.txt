A modern design solution for an age old problem—space.
Finding clever and efficient ways of using space that we already occupy is always a challenge. Now there is a solution. Expand the visual and functional size of your space with a contemporary aluminum loft or bunk bed from Francis Lofts & Bunks.
Bunk Bed
We are one of the only providers of queen and king sized bunk beds. Our 2,000 pound weight limit means that our customers can comfortably sleep more adult guests in their home.

Loft Bed
Our loft beds are in use all over America and even internationally, enabling adults in studio apartments and other small spaces to increase the size of their home without sacrificing design appeal.

Standard Bed
Featuring the same durable materials used in our heavy duty bunk beds. Since our contemporary standard beds do not require a box spring, there is ample space for storage or a trundle underneath.
