Testimonials
The (Pro-Elite) stand, is awesome! I’ve never owned one before but it was honestly on my list of things to purchase this year, as my apartment currently houses a growing collection 5 bikes and doesn’t show signs of slowing. I’ve used several different brand stands at one point or another and they all have seemed a bit clumsy in some way. I got right to setting up and playing with my stand when I got home from the expo and was so pleased. It took about 30 seconds to get it in place, adjusted, and my bike mounted. And it shows no signs of that wobble/tipsy-ness that I’ve encountered in other stands.
It was wonderful meeting some of the the people behind Feedback Sports (at the Bike NY Expo). Having been both a participant and a demonstrator at many expos it’s refreshing to see people who really enjoy what they are doing and stand behind their products. Thank you guys a ton!

I’ve used the Omnium for all my warm-ups at the World Cups this year. Using the trainer exclusively for warm-ups is a little new for me but it’s good practice for Rio. The Omnium packs well in my EVOC bike case (my small frame size makes that possible) although it can probably be checked separately for travel. It’s the best [trainer] out there.
