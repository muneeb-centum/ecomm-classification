Personalized Hockey Pucks and Sport Balls are Our Specialty
Let's face it: when it comes to finding a coach gift or team gift it is often difficult to find the perfect gift. No need to look any further for the best gifts for your coach and team. We specialize in customized hockey pucks, lacrosse balls, baseballs, softballs, golf balls - and even ping pong and tennis balls. A personalized lacrosse ball with the team logo, player names, or team numbers make a long-lasting and perfect gift for lacrosse players to celebrate a championship win or for the end of the season. Hockey coaches from around the country proudly display or “thanks, coach” custom printed or engraved hockey pucks, Our personalized baseballs, other sports balls, and pucks have also been used as baby announcements, engagement announcements, party favors, and even we’re surprised by the creative and fun uses we’ve seen. We are so proud of our professional quality personalized sports balls, pucks and custom mini hockey sticks - all ideal to commemorate a special occasion, and a player and coach favorite for the end of the season.
