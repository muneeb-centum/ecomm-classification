What Customers Say About Us
I have put over 200 miles on my EVELO in the past few weeks. Nothing but fun. And more fun! After 25 miles on pedal assist I still have over half a battery charge left. Hills become flat. I have been riding on pavement, dirt roads, and trails in the forest. Riding a regular bike is quite a bit of work in hilly areas like where I live. My EVELO makes riding fun.

Try EVELO at Home
Buying an electric bike online is a big decision. We understand that, and so every EVELO comes with a 10-day trial period. Take it for a ride around the block or up that hill and if you don’t absolutely love it, we’ll take it back or exchange it for another. We’ll even cover the return shipping costs, and there are no hidden fees.
