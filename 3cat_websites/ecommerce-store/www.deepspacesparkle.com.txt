We help adults teach art to kids
How can we help?
You know art is super important for kids, but you don’t know how to start.
Maybe you are wondering how to get 25 Kinders to paint on the paper instead of their faces.
You want to do the pretty projects but aren’t sure what supplies to use. You got the desire but not the know-how.
I get it and that’s where I can help.
