ABOUT DESSER
Desser Tire & Rubber Company, LLC was started in 1920 in Los Angeles, California.
Over the next three-quarters of a century, Desser has been in all aspects of the tire industry and has handled all types of rubber in addition to aircraft tires. Over the last 20 years, Desser has slowly withdrawn from other types of rubber products to become the leader in the aircraft tire market.
In 1989, Desser opened it's Memphis warehouse facility to answer the demand of its customers in the eastern USA. With Los Angeles and Memphis warehouses, Desser can deliver products to most addresses in the United States in two days.
Today, Desser is known as the market leader in aircraft tires and tubes, providing over 100,000 aircraft tires and tubes annually in over 85 countries. And our friendly, well trained staff will handle all of your needs.
