COFFEE made for MAKERS.
™
Bold on buzz and easy on the stomach, Chameleon Cold-Brew coffee does right by you every time and every way — milky or straight, icy or hot. And yes, there are times when we’ve been known to add a shot. A simple cup transforms a dreamer into a do-er, and a planner becomes a creator. When we’ve all got the right coffee, we’re making a world that’s more vibrant, more giving and just plain better. So let’s raise our Chameleons — Organic & CCB Trade True: Here’s to the Makers of the world that make it better.
WHAT’S Cold Brew COFFEE?
The components are simple, but all cold brew coffees are not created equal. A growing number of products pass as cold brew coffee on the shelf but fall short of the head of the class. At Chameleon Cold-Brew, we don’t believe in ‘good enough’ or doing anything on a pass/fail basis. We go to great lengths to ensure that every drop of our organic cold brew coffee is the very best you’ll ever taste. It’s about accountability, to you and to our craft.
Invest in quality. Our coffees are made with highly select blends of 100% certified organic, free trade Arabica beans and all-natural flavors.

JUST PLAIN BETTER
Sweet, smooth success starts at the source, so our Chameleon Cold-Brew Sourcing Standards are tough. They are what we’re all about. Direct trade and good communication with the farmers is our first step toward a feel-good cup of coffee. We also keep our global search narrow-only organic, non-GMO beans can come home with us, where they get washed and air-roasted to perfection in small batches.
