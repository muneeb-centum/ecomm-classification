Treating Sensitive Skin
Here's the truth with sensitive skin: a huge number of people suffer from over-sensitivity and the majority aren't doing what they need to in order to treat it. Chronic skin conditions like eczema and rosacea can trigger chemical sensitivity but so can environmental factors like temperature or sun exposure. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) more than 50% of dermatology patients visit their physician seeking sensitive skin treatments.
You don't have to let it get as far as a doctor's visit--most with high sensitivity are simply using the wrong products for their skin.
Cleure offers high-quality, gluten-free and hypoallergenic products for sensitive skin which are free of abrasive, irritating, rash-inducing chemicals. This includes the common crooks found in most modern creams and makeup like parabens, certain sulfates, salicylates, and harmful fragrances. Created by Dr. Flora Parsa Stay and her formulation team, the Cleure product line offers a robust array of choices designed to manage skin care without caustic side effects, from fragrance-free soaps and moisturizers to sensitive skin lotions and deodorants.
