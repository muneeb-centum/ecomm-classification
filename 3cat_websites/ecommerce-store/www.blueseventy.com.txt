#ALLFORTHESWIM
There isn’t a second that goes by when we're not thinking about you.
How you eat, breathe, train, play, win, lose, suffer and celebrate.
How swimming is every part of what makes you tick.

Aptly named because 70% of the earth is covered in water, we make products that empower swimmers to achieve their personal bests. Since 1993, we design, test, refine and craft products using superior materials and revolutionary details that equate to comfort, freedom from restriction and ultimately a competitive advantage in the water.

This is where we thrive.
There is no substitute and no way around it.
We’re all for the swim.
