USA Made Quality
Our jump ropes are assembled here in Leavenworth, WA using the best, most durable parts and materials we can find. Putting our ropes together by hand allows us to both guarantee the quality of every rope we send out, and to personalize jump rope sizes and colors specific to the customer.  
The original inventor of the world's first cable speed rope (the Ultra Speed), we have since evolved into the world’s leader in jump rope technology, innovation and expertise. Have questions about our products, an order, or just skipping rope in general? We are easy to reach by phone or email.
