Jeremy, South Carolina
"I have now bought two of the Vector Units because I basically fell in love with the first one! I know it say's in the description; "We haven't tried this on larger aircraft" but I actually successfully use it constantly on my Giant Scale Top Flite P-51D Mustang! I haven't tuned it to where it will land itself yet but if I get into trouble or my gas engine craps out, I flip a switch and glide her in, I don't know how they did it but these guys certainly have the Flight Controller's down to a science! I use the other one on a almost 600 sized (558mm) Quadcopter, same story with it. The only difference is the Quad is running the V2 GPS/Mag and the Plank is running the V1, and the plank also has the airspeed and InfoPanel Display. But I am about to purchase the V2 for it and the InfoPanel for the Quad. Don't waste your time (and of course, money!) buying all those other FPV systems like I did, stick with the guys who have done it for years! That Giant Scale P-51D has approximately $2500 work of electronics; from the Hitec Telemetry, all 10 of the HiTec Digital Servos, Engine electronics, electric Robart Retracts, the small pneumatic system I have for landing gear doors and probably several more things I can't think of right now! Out of all this work, money and time that I spent building, installing, fiberglassing/painting and etc. I wanted a proven system, the Vector has saved me from destruction too many times to count and I will not fly without it! But don't just take my word for it, try it for yourself and you'll be just as amazed as I was! Just wanted to say thanks to all of the Vector guys, this system is phenomenal, Jeremy, Aiken, South Carolina "
