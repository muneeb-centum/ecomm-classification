WELCOME TO THE WORLD'S BEST BAR. AGAIN.
HELLO, TRADITION.
MEET TOMORROW.
‘THE DEAD RABBIT TAKES A TIME-HONOURED TRADITION OF HOSPITALITY, A SENSE OF HISTORY AND YOUNG, DYNAMIC STAFF AND TURNS THEM INTO A MODERN IRISH BAR THAT IS ACCESSIBLE, IRRESISTIBLE, EVEN FIERCELY ROMANTIC.’ - THE GUARDIAN
WE’VE ALWAYS LOVED TRADITIONAL IRISH BARS. BUT WE’VE ALSO ALWAYS WANTED TO BRING THAT TRADITION INTO THE 21ST CENTURY.SO WE KEPT ALL THAT WAS BEST ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE – THE WARMTH, THE CONVIVIALITY, THE WHOLE SURE-WHERE’S-YOUR-RUSH? VIBE.
AND WE UPDATED EVERYTHING ELSE, WITH MIND-BLOWINGLY GOOD COCKTAILS. AMAZING SELECTIONS OF WHISKEY (AND WHISKY). FOOD TO DIET FOR. ENTERTAINMENT. THE BEST CREW. THE WORKS. SO, YES, IT’S TRADITION.
BUT WITH A ZESTY TWIST.
WELCOME TO THE DEAD RABBIT
OUR STORY
LET THE DOGS SEE THE RABBIT
TWO INNOCENT GUYS WITH JUST A HEADFUL OF DREAMS AND STARDUST IN THEIR EYES. THAT’S WHO WE ELBOWED PAST AS WE HAULED OUT OF JFK, LOOKED AROUND AND SAID, ‘OK, NEW YORK. YOU’LL DO.’
YOU SEE, WE’D ALREADY COME A LONG WAY.
ONE OF US WAS JACK MCGARRY – COCKTAIL VIRTUOSO, WALKING DRINKS ENCYCLOPEDIA AND SOON TO BE INTERNATIONAL BARTENDER OF THE YEAR. 
THE OTHER WAS SEAN MULDOON, ICE-OBSESSIVE, DETAIL OBSESSIVE, AND ALREADY THE CREATIVE FORCE BEHIND A WORLD’S BEST COCKTAIL BAR (THE MERCHANT, BACK HOME IN BELFAST).
TWO TOP DOGS IN SEARCH OF A RABBIT. THEN WE FOUND ONE.
