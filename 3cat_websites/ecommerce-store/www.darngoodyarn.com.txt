WELCOME TO DARN GOOD YARN
Our story begins with the sari. Over thousands of years, this traditional Indian garment has evolved from a simple throw to a beautiful, vibrantly dyed and intricately patterned dress, shawl and scarf. Today, the dyers and spinners and weavers of silk yarn have all been replaced by machines and factories, which pump out thousands of saris a day and rely on low-paid labor and plenty of waste.
There are, nonetheless, some who are working to preserve the ancient arts of spinning and knitting sari silk yarn. Women’s cooperatives, set up in India and Nepal, are reclaiming the offcuts and discards from these factories and using them to spin sari silk yarn. Hobbyists and knitters the world over are rediscovering this high-quality traditional fiber.
That’s where we come in. Our online yarn store is dedicated to supporting women’s economic empowerment, fair trade practices, and principles of environmental sustainability. Our yarn store offers dozens of other fibers, cloths and wholesale yarn through our online yarn store, allowing knitters access to these rare and special items. In doing so, we hope to encourage the joy of knitting, beautiful garments, and ethical consumerism.
Check out our yarn store online and grab yourself some of our gorgeous wholesale yarn. Don’t forget to download some of our free patterns, or pick up some of our pre-made garments handmade by artisans from around the world. Most of all, remember to smile – when you shop with Darn Good Yarn, you’re helping to make the world a better place!
