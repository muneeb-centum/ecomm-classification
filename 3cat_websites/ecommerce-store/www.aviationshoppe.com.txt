One of the Industry’s Oldest Presentations…
Blueprints explain quickly the most difficult mechanical concepts

In order to understand the principles, one must first have something tangible to grasp onto from this era…
— something you can see, touch, feel,
and hold on to.



  We sell blueprints; they lay bare a machine’s inner workings for prying eyes to see…
 Take a peek… you experience a unique form of inspiration… now a portal into a bygone era, they allow your imagination to ponder our history, our challenges, and our aspirations.

The Future of Developed Blueprints…




Why is the aircraft blueprint
  …the heart of an aviator’s collection?

 What our customers tell us:
“ one of a kind - unique ”
“ —a must have ”
“ impressive ”

“I have spent a lot more on other gifts that don't come anywhere close to this. GREAT VALUE FOR THE MONEY and now my new favorite...” Mattthew J. Pinson ~ La Center, Washington
