LIMITED EDITION EARPEACE
"These earplugs actually work. While it’s not true that reading in bed will ruin your eyesight, it’s pretty easy to set yourself up for fifty years of aural unhappiness in exchange for just a few too-loud experiences."
— Seth Godin | Bestselling Author, Entrepreneur, Marketer and Public Speaker
"All in all, I am fanatically impressed with practically every aspect of EarPeace. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys live shows and values their hearing or to anyone who’s got a job that puts their hearing at risk in above moderate noise atmospheres."
— Spencer W. | FOH Sound Engineer, Pinnacle Entertainment

"We are very happy to work with EarPeace again at our 25th anniversary event. Especially this year, we wanted to provide a great memento and go that extra step to provide stylish and discreet hearing protection that delivers a superior concert experience."
— Darin Klein | Director of Special Projects, SXSW
"When I first read the reviews for this EarPeace I thought that surely they were stretching the truth. After receiving my own pair, I can gladly confirm that the reviews are spot on! EarPeace does a great job of lowering the volume without distorting the sound. I'm VERY impressed and have already recommended to several friends!"
— K. White | Pittsburgh PA

A Ringing Endorsement for Ear Plugs!
"To best test EarPeace, I hit up one of my favorite bands. With the plugs in, the sound was much more focused, less encumbered by reverb. And this time around my ears were completely tinnitus-free after the show. Added bonus: it was much easier to hear my friends talking to me while in the venue, which makes for a lot less shouting. Bottom Line: EarPeace is functional, comfortable and really enhances your concert-going experience. If you go to as many shows a week as I do — and want to be able to hear the sweet, sweet voices of your grandkids in years to come — I recommend picking up a set!"
— Brenna Ehrlich | Associate Editor of Media & Entertainment, Mashable
