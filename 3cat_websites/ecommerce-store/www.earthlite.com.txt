WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING A MASSAGE TABLE
Over a period of time, more and more people are seeing the benefits of massage. This means that more tables are being utilized as well. For both massage therapists and massage lovers, massage tables are essential. Providing a comfortable massage table for your client to lie on should be expected. If this is not the case, it will affect the entire massage experience. When shopping for a new or used massage table, there are several factors to consider.
First and foremost on the list of importance is the quality of the table. It should strong and stable. For this reason alone the cheapest one on the market will not do. An effective table should be well constructed so it will last for a long time no matter how much you use it or how much weight it has on it over time. So, make sure to check the weight limit of the table and ensure that it includes a good warranty. With that said, it’s known that Earthlite is one of the most reliable and solid manufacturing companies in the market. Earthlite has been providing massage therapists amazing quality equipment for years. Its reputation is well-earned and deserved.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STATIONARY TABLE AND A PORTABLE TABLE
If you are a massage therapist, the pros and cons of either portable or stationary are important to note. Portable tables are flexible enough to handle and light enough to carry to any venue. The drawback is that portable massage tables tend to bend a little bit. Therefore, if you want a stronger and more rigid table it’s best to choose a stationary table since they are not prone to flexing. Why is that? Standard stationary massage tables have higher weight capacities that are normally double the limit of portable models.
Keep in mind, there is upkeep and maintenance of either type. With portable tables that will be situated in busy massage centers, regular maintenance is required to ensure proper safety standards are met. In the long run, make sure when choosing between a stationary table or a portable table that you understand what your primary use will be. Below goes into more detail on how to decide between a stationary massage table and a portable massage table.
