Steve & Tim's Weekly Recommendation
At first glance, I am struck by the sleek and sexy white dial which is in complete contrast to the black Arabic numbers. This outstanding men's watch is the perfect example of a men's dress watch that can also be worn as a sport watch. This luxury watch is 39.5 mm in diameter and is beyond comfortable on the wrist. The watch even comes with a luxurious box to hold it in. Being one of the best watch brands, this may quickly become one of your favorite watches.

The basis of this watch goes all the way back to the year 1833, before the adoption of Standard Time. In this time period, time was dependent on the position of the sun. This resulted in every city having its own uniques time zone. This complicated system made it impeccably hard for the railroad companies to have synchronized railroad timetables. The U.S railroad companies soon changed this system, and since 1833, the way of ‘Standard Time’ has been used in almost every city across America. The Standard Time rule separates the country into four different time zones. This change has made the use of the sun to tell time seem like a vintage tactic, and has since led to the disappearance of more than 70 official time zones, and has continued as the official time system to the present day.

The Ball Trainmaster Standard Time NM3888D-LL1CJ-WH price is $2,499, which is considered a great price point for this timepiece. In comparison with its fellow Trainmaster watches, the watch is on the lower side of the price range. View Watch
