  About INS
INS distributes products, offers technical support and provides IT services for wired and wireless machine networking applications. Since its founding in 1998, INS has seen the industry space it serves evolve from “Industrial Ethernet” to “Machine-to-Machine” (M2M) and now the “Internet of Things” (IoT). Throughout these changes in industry jargon, though, one thing has stayed constant: INS’s commitment to provide our customers with best-in-class products, support and services for their critical wired and wireless machine networking applications.
