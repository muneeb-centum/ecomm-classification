Watermark's Book of the Week is The Ministry of Utmost Happiness by Arundhati Roy.
The Ministry of Utmost Happiness takes us on an intimate journey of many years across the Indian subcontinent—from the cramped neighborhoods of Old Delhi and the roads of the new city to the mountains and valleys of Kashmir and beyond, where war is peace and peace is war. Roy's debut novel The God of Small Things won the Booker Prize in 1997 and was published to rave reviews all around the world. Her new novel was published to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut. 
Online or in the store, The Ministry of Utmost Happiness is 30% off until August 14th.

Published: HarperFestival - June 27th, 2017
The Children's Book of the Week this week is The Noisy Book by Margaret Wise Brown, and illustrated by Leonard Weisgard. 
Originally published in 1939 and out of print for years, the public is begging for a new printing of THE NOISY BOOKS. Maria Popova at www.brainpickings.org says, “the subtle sweetness of the story unfolds with a distinct mid-century aesthetic of primary colors and bold graphics…[the world] awaits some enterprising publisher to take profitable pity on this vintage gem.”
Online or in the store, The Noisy Book is 30% off until August 14th.
