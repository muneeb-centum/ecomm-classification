WHO COMPOSES WITH EASTWEST?
If you're lucky, the tools themselves will inspire you. It looks- and sounds- like EastWest/Quantum Leap does just that with every new product they release.
J.J. Abrams
Director/Creator: Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Star Trek, Lost
Having new sounds at my fingertips is always an inspiration and these new EastWest/Quantum Leap PLAY plug-ins have plenty of great sounds to choose from.
James Newton Howard
The Hunger Games, The Bourne Legacy, Snow White etc.
EastWest has become an important part of my sonic template. I am using EW/QL Pianos and Silk in my scores and I am using Stormdrum right now on Terminator.
Danny Elfman
American Hustle, Silver Linings Playbook, Alice In Wonderland
