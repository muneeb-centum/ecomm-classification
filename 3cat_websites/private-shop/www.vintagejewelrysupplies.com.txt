VINTAGEJEWELRYSUPPLIES.COM: WHOLESALE VINTAGE JEWELRY MAKING
VINTAGE JEWELRY SUPPLIES IS THE LEADING WHOLESALE JEWELRY MAKING SUPPLIER IN THE US AND IN THE WORLD. WE WERE ESTABLISHED IN 1989.
The Vintage Jewelry Supplies Company Inc. is the leader in handmade vintage jewelry making supplies. We have been serving jewelry designers since 1989 as a major source for brass stamping components, plated in rich antique patinas including oxidized sterling silver, brass and copper.
We also offer many items in raw brass for artists who wish to add their own patinas. Many of the pieces we feature are still made from the original dies inspired by the Victorian period and created in the late 1800's.
We are a web site business only. The lowest prices we can afford to offer are listed on each item. We do not have print catalogs or a showroom.
Orders received Monday through Thursday after 1:00 p.m. EST are usually processed and mailed on the same day. Orders placed after 1:00 p.m. EST on Fridays will not be shipped until Monday.
Our vintage jewelry collection includes unique glass jewelry stones and vintage beads, many of which are no longer made. If an item from our site will no longer be available after our current inventory is sold, we have almost always mentioned that fact in the description for your planning purposes.
When we started selling on eBay in 2000 under the name 'AccessoriesSusan', we were one of the first companies to offer vintage jewelry components at wholesale on the web. After selling millions of items on eBay and other auction sites, we now sell exclusively from our own web sites. We are not affiliated with any other seller(s) or web site(s). We do not own any "ghost" web sites pretending to be authorized dealers of our products in order to charge you higher prices for the items we sell.
If you buy large quantities of our items often, please email us with a list of those item numbers. Otherwise, we may run out when you need the items most..
