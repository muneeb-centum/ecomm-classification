LONGEVITY offers portable diesel generators. By maintaining the highest quality standards for plasma cutting equipment, welding equipment, welding helmets also known as auto-darkening helmets, and silent diesel generators, the Longevity Welding and Generator brands are certainly getting attention for many welding jobs and from metal workers throughout the world because how portable, affordable, and reliable each and every plasma cutter, welder, and auto-darkening welding helmet actually is. With our ForceCut and MaxArc series plasma cutters, we have dominated the metal cutting market where power and portability are necessary. LONGEVITY also offers the WeldMax series plasma cutter / Arc / STICK / TIG multi-process welders that can plasma cut and weld from one single machine. With the WeldAll series, we have enabled cutting and welding from one unit that will also weld aluminum. Check out our multi-purpose welders to see the affordable pricing. If you need just a small or portable TIG, MIG / MAG, or ARC / STICK Welder, the LONGEVITY ArcMate series is perfectly designed to enable good quality welds.
