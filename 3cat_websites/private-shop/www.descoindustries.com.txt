Company Profile
Originally incorporated in 1956, Delta Electrical Specialty Company (DESCO) manufactured and sold a continuity/voltage tester called the Circuitracer. In 1979 the parent company of Desco Industries Inc. (DII) was established. DII now consists of brands including Desco, Desco Asia, EMIT, Menda, Protektive Pak, Smart Clock, Statguard Flooring, Charleswater, and Vermason. The same basic design used for the original Circuitracer is still manufactured today and is offered through the Menda brand.

DII has expanded its inventory and manufacturing locations to include one in Japan, two UK locations, and seven USA locations. The core product groups manufactured by DII are for ESD control in electronics manufacturing areas. These product groups include bags, wrist straps, worksurface and floor matting, laminates, foot grounders, smocks, gloves, flooring, ionizers, continuous monitors, testers, tape, dispensing bottles, document holders and other workbench accessories. DII also manufactures non-ESD products including chemicals, grounding, personnel identification, material handling, time and attendance, and training products.

DII has grown through the development of new products and the acquisition of companies that fit within our business model. A worldwide network of sales representatives provides local end user support for our products. Customer service groups are available for technical and other inquiries.
