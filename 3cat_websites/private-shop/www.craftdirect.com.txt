We have all kinds of craft supplies at discount prices, ranging from electronic cutting machines to patterned cardstock stacks. Creating with CraftDirect can be a lot of fun, in part because we have you covered for a number of project types:
Scrapbooking
If you like to scrapbook, you have come to the right place. We have a large selection of discount scrapbook supplies, including designer albums, photo sheets, page protectors, scrapbook page kits, and tons of paper, like solid-colored cardstock.
Homemade Cards
Homemade cards are becoming more and more popular among crafters. Not only is it a fun hobby, but it can be (not always) an inexpensive solution for your greeting card needs. Make cards and embellishments and personalize each project just the way you like it. We have paper, dies, embossing folders, machines, cartridges, tools, accessories, and everything else that you need to make cards. One of the best solutions for making cards are Sizzix dies.
Home Decor
If you are big into home decorating, then you will love what we have to offer. We have fun kits that will allow you to decorate in unique ways, as well as DIY picture frames, banners, gallery prints, holiday decor, party decor, and of course tons of vinyl!
