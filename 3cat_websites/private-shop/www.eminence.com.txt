How Speakers are Built
POINT TO POINT
The first electronic loudspeaker designs were introduced in the 1920’s, and while there have been many improvements in component materials over the decades, not much has changed in the basic functionality of a loudspeaker: a permanent magnet interacts with an electromagnet (voice coil) to move a cone back and forth to produce sound waves. Founded in 1966, Eminence has been a leading supplier of loudspeakers for professional audio, musical instrument, car audio and home hi-fi applications to many of the world’s most recognized brands. While our own components and manufacturing processes have evolved, the way we assemble speakers today doesn’t differ that much from when we started. Here’s how we do it.

New Products for 2017
Eminence is proud to introduce the following high quality pro audio and musical instrument products for 2017.
N151M-8 RING RADIATOR
Despite its minute size, the 1” exit N151M-8 ring radiator compression driver delivers monumental performance. Weighing in at a mere 1.7 lbs., the N151M-8 utilizes a phase plug design that improves the distribution of forces over the diaphragm surface, which results in a driver with lower distortion, smoother frequency response, and increased sensitivity as compared to conventional ring radiator designs.
