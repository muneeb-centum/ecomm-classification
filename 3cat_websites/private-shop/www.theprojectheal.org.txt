PROJECT HEAL'S ADVICE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND DISCUSSION GUIDE
Netflix launched TO THE BONE on July 14, 2017. This film follows the journey of a 20 year old female who is living with anorexia nervosa. In response to the film, Project HEAL developed a discussion guide to assist viewers in talking about eating disorders. Please also view our FAQs for additional information on this film and Project HEAL’s involvement with the film.

Recovery is possible. When people who suffer from an eating disorder are able to receive comprehensive treatment, they CAN regain a healthy relationship with food and live full and happy lives. Project HEAL knows this is true through the first- hand experience of its founders, supporters and volunteers, as well as through the testimonials and success stories of the organization’s grant recipients.
Founders of Project HEAL, Liana & Kristina
