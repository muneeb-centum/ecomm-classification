"You were very helpful and the carpet was just as described. I priced carpet for several weeks and your prices were by far the best. I usually buy from a wholesale carpets dealer in the Dallas area and your prices were a dollar square foot cheaper for the exact same carpet than from any other carpet wholesale outlet."
