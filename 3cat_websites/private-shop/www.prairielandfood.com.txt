It has been my pleasure to answer your questions, be your personal shopper, and to be here in anyway I can to help you and your families be a part of Prairie Land Food. I have really enjoyed the friendships made by email and phone over the last 11 years.

Unfortunately, there just are not enough customers like you to cover the costs... so with a really heavy heart, I have to let you know that July 2017 will be the last distribution for Prairie Land Food.

For July customers, receipts with information for pick up have been sent, please check for them and let me know if you do not have them, if not I will resend it to you..

If you use Yahoo email you may have to log into your Yahoo account online and check your Bulk or Junk Mail folder for our replies. Yahoo email is among the worst at improperly misdirecting valid emails. If you do not get a reply from us be sure to check these folders before re-contacting us.
