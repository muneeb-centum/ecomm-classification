QUESTION OF THE WEEK
Do You Have a Typical Routine You Follow to Regain Form after Vacation?
I almost only take cycling vacations, so I'm not off the bike much.
Yes. I try to follow the same routine (training plan) after every long period off the bike.
Sort of. I usually have a plan but tend to play it by ear.
Not really. I just start riding again.
Nah. I'm not that serious anyway. So a break doesn't much matter.
I never have a long period off the bike, so this doesn't apply to me.
Something else.

The new site looks great. No other source, either print or digital, offers a more complete source of information about road cycling. Your product information, technical reviews, training books and industry news are outstanding.
