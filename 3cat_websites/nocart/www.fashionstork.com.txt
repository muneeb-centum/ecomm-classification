Cedar Hill Furniture
"Dayton and Springfield's Quality Furniture store - Locally owned & operated serving the Miami Valley for over 40 years!!"
Founded by three brothers and a brother-in-law in 1972, Cedar Hill Furniture began offering quality furniture for less from its very beginning. Family owned and operated, their focus was to offer a HUGE selection of quality furniture in Dayton, Springfield & the surrounding Miami Valley area at the absolute best price. This idea has been reinforced as the second generation of family have continued on the Cedar Hill Furniture mission. "Quality, Comfort, and Style" & "Made in the U.S.A." are a few reasons why Cedar Hill Furniture stands out from the rest.
"You're Gonna Love the Change"

Hint, a local family business offering better quality furniture, personal family-like service, and leaving you with the satisfaction of knowing you made the best choice for your family & your home. Our customers appreciate our approach to furniture and mattresses and leave our stores humming the words... "at Cedar Hill Furniture, you're gonna love the change." And that brings a smile to our faces.
