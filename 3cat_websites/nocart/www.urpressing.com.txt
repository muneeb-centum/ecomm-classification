A Note from United Record Pressing
Hello from the team here at United Record Pressing!
As you may know we have been pressing records in two facilities last year. In order to streamline our processes and optimize our quality, output, and turnaround times, we have consolidated operations into our new facility located on Allied Drive in Nashville, TN. The new plant is a significantly larger, more modern operation - enabling an increase in our capacity of over 50%, and was needed to keep up with he rapid demand for our vinyl; record pressing services.
Finally for those of you who love our original historic land in Nashville as much as we do, we can assure you that we are committed to preserving it in a way that honors its important place in musical history.
Thank you,
United Record Pressing
