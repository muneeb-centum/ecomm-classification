Review of Ladies Night Out at Board and Brush in Louisville, KY
We were granted admission for purpose of review
I recently had a girls' night at Board and Brush Louisville. It's located in the East End, right off 265. It's conveniently situated next to a Mexican restaurant for chips and margaritas right before or after! (Board and Brush also has a bar and snacks for sale which was great to have while creating our projects).

Prior to arriving, we registered for a specific wood project online. They have a TON of pictures to choose from in their online gallery. We took care to fill out our names, dates, and other details, with accurate spelling. Word to the wise - the smaller the words/designs/font, the more difficult your project will be. For your first project, you may want to choose a project with big letters, and not a lot of detail work.

Upon arrival, we checked in and found our pieces of wood and pre-cut stencil waiting for us. It was so convenient to have this prepared in advance. After we checked the spelling on our stencils, they explained the process we were about to follow, and we got to work. We also picked out a wine to share.

Kids Consignment Sales around Louisville, Fall 2017

This is a partially sponsored post.

KidStuff Sale is Kentuckiana’s original children’s consignment event and can help you make the most of your family’s budget. For over 20 years, KidStuff Sale has been the one-stop shop for parents and families looking to stock up and save on everything they need for their kids. Our events consistently draw thousands of local parents and grandparents ready and willing to shop big. KidStuff Sale consignors earn more for their items than at yard sales or local consignment shops. KidStuff Sale provides a wide variety of high-quality items at even better prices. Our merchandise includes children’s clothing, indoor and outdoor toys, strollers, car seats and high chairs, bikes, books, games, nursery items, and much more.
KidStuff Sale is independently owned and run by and for local families. For Fall 2017, we’ll be in three locations.
Our Louisville event is at the Ramada Conference Center on August 24-27.
Our Oldham County event is at the Oldham County Family YMCA on September 15-17.
Our Southern Indiana event is at the Southern Indiana Sports Complex on September 22-24.
Visit our website or Facebook for more information about consigning. See you soon!

Kentucky Kids Consignment Elizabethtown Sale features everything babies, kids, teens, and expecting moms need! We'll have toys, furniture, infant gear, toys, shoes, hundreds of Halloween costumes, bedding, books, games, toys, women's handbags, sports equipment, toys, DVD's, accessories, and did we mention toys? With over 700 sellers and 75,000 items, there should be something for everyone! Sellers earn at least 70% of each item's selling price. Our Preferred Sellers who help during sale week are the first to shop at two exclusive presales. Located less than 3 miles from exit 94 of I-65 in Pritchard Community Center, 404 S. Mulberry Street, Elizabethtown, just a quick drive from Jefferson County. Find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and visit our website for more details.

Open for shopping: Wednesday, September 20 from 7 pm to 9 pm for our VIP Presale - tickets $12.50 and VERY LIMITED! This is the only time there is an admission charge to shop!
Thursday, September 21 from 9 am to 8 pm Friday, September 22 from 9 am to 8 pm RESTOCKED with new inventory! Saturday, September 23 from 9 am to 4 pm with many remaining items half price!

I bet your little ones love trucks, mine did when they were younger. Clarksville is hosting a FREE Touch-a-Truck event at Gateway Park from 6-8pm. Children will be able to get up close and personal with the cool trucks and construction equipment they see on the road everyday. Vehicles include police cruisers, fire trucks, construction equipment, limousines, box trucks, and much more! Face painting, balloon animals too.  After Touch-A-Truck, stick around for Disney’s “Moana” beginning at dusk. Be sure to bring a blanket or lawn chair for the movie.

Review of topp't Handcrafted Pizza & Chopped Salads in New Albany, IN
Complimentary food was provided in exchange for this review.
This past week my family and I were given the opportunity to try out topp't Handcrafted Pizza & Chopped Salads in New Albany. We went on a Friday night and the line was about 8 people long, but it went fast! It was just enough time to look over their menu and figure out what we were going to order.

My daughters each got a topp't kids meal which included a 1 topping mini pizza, drink, and s'mores chip for $4.99. I have been to other pizza restaurants that didn't offer kids meals, so I loved that they had this option. Also, kids eat free on Wednesdays, so that's a great time to visit!

Review of Paddleboarding with Endless Summer Paddle at Taylorsville Lake
Writers were granted free admission for purpose of review.

Recently, some LFF writers and their families were able to enjoy a couple hours on the water at Taylorsville Lake State Park. We went out with a company called Endless Summer Paddle. They supply the paddleboats, paddles, life vests, instruction, and guides. You can go out on the water with a guides like we did, or you can rent the equipment and go out on your own. When we enjoyed the 2 hour experience (summer 2017) it was $40 per board to go out on their 2 hour instructional tour. For rental, $20 for the 1st hour and $20 for each additional hour per board. Their rule of thumb is that kids 10 and up can have their own board, but an 8 year old in our group demonstrated good balance and control of the board, and they had no problem letting her have her own paddleboard. Please not that during periods of high debris in the paddleboard area, the company prefers to have children ride on their parents' boards.
