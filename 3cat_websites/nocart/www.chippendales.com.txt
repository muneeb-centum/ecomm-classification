Vegas Show
Chippendales Las Vegas is a mantastic, sex-god, abs party that will make you lose your damn mind… in the best way of course! The guys bring down the house (and drop trou) on stage at their very own theater in the Rio All Suites Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. They go hard every night, and twice on weekends, so you and your friends can get some action whenever you need it. Whether you’re celebrating a Bachelorette bash or your own sheer awesomeness, you can meet your party match with the men of Chippendales.
