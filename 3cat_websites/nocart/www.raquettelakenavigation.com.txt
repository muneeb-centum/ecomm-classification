About Raquette Lake Navigation
Raquette Lake Navigation Company has been family owned and operated for 26 years. Known for our delicious food, meticulously clean and well-maintained vessel, attention to detail, hospitality and personal touch, we’ve been navigating one of the most beautiful lakes in the Adirondacks since 1991. We offer a variety of cruise and tour options for out of town visitors and locals alike.
Explore the pristine and relatively undeveloped environment of Raquette Lake aboard the W.W. Durant and enjoy fascinating extemporaneous historic commentary provided by Captain Dean Pohl. Learn about the history of Raquette Lake, which was the playground for millionaires during the Gilded Age and home to wilderness retreats built for JP Morgan, Alfred Vanderbilt, Collis P. Huntington, the Carnegies, the Colliers and other prestigious families.  In fact, the word “vacation” was coined during this era:  the wealthy “vacated” their homes in the hot, dirty city for the cooler, salubrious air of the mountains.
