Discover the Beauty of California Native Plants
The Theodore Payne Foundation, established 1960, operates a year-round, retail nursery offering the region’s largest and most interesting selection of California native plants – hundreds of different species and cultivars, many of which are drought tolerant and low maintenance. Our Education Center and Outreach programs offer classes and field trips for adults and children.

Our mission is to preserve, propagate and promote California native plants, seeds and wild flowers – native treasures that conserve water and other resources, provide habitat for wildlife, and add color and fragrance to the garden. Our Sun Valley grounds in the NE corner of the San Fernando Valley (map) are a great place to visit. The TPF store stocks books, seeds, garden tools and more. You’ll also find an art gallery, picnic area, hiking trails and expert staff to answer questions about native plants. On-leash dogs are welcome. There is no admission fee.

Be a good Californian; be loyal to your own state and keep your landscape Californian. - Theodore Payne
