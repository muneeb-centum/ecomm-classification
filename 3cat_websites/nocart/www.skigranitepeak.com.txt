MORE INFORMATION
Fun For All. Runs for All
Granite Peak at Rib Mountain State Park is the largest and most complete ski resort in Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan. With 700' of vertical, that's higher than any other ski area, and 75 runs, that's more than any other mountain, and 3 high speed lifts, that's more time skiing and less time riding the lifts - well, it's not difficult to see why Granite Peak is the number one family ski destination in the Midwest. Set on 405 acres, we have the largest and most perfect mix of beginner, intermediate and expert runs, including 4 terrain parks, 3 mogul runs, multiple tree skiing glades, and if that's not enough, we have an entire chalet village, a great ski school, and the city of Wausau, Wisconsin with 20 hotels, dozens of restaurants, and an active schedule of nightly entertainment, sits at the base of our mountain. That's why we're your Mountain of Family Fun.
