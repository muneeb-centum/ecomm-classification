Executive Functions in Health and Disease: New book to help integrate Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology
By: Dr. Elkhonon Goldberg
__________
Neuroscience used to be the monopoly of a few elite universities located in a handful of countries. Neuropsychology used to be a quaint niche discipline relatively unconnected to the larger world of neuroscience and content in its methods with paper-and-pencil tests. Read the rest of this entry »

Harnessing neurotech for actual Human Enhancement — i.e., how to prevent ‘Frankenstein’ Brains
By: SharpBrains

___
The Neurotech Revolution Could Lead To ‘Frankenstein’ Brains. Here’s How We Avoid It (Forbes):
“Year 2030, your college-age daughter, who has normal hearing, has been pounding on you to get the latest hearing aid that allows one to cancel out noise on demand, amplify selected ambient conversations at will, and can easily connect to the music store. Should you buy one for her? Maybe you should buy one not only for her, but also for you as you enter your 60s?
Would you still be interested if this device had to be implanted in your cochlea via surgery? What if this device is now augmented with some AI opening the possibility to eave-drop on remote conversations or get automatic translation in any language of the world in real time?…
What are the risks over the benefits? To what extent are enhancements desirable on a personal and societal levels? What if people that undergo such enhancement lose their ability to relate to other who have not? If a device can enhance decision-making, how will the user know that’s it’s truly their decision, in their best interest, rather than being manipulated by the device designers?

Will we soon have an “annual brain check-up” — and what may it look like?
By: Alvaro Fernandez
Will we soon have an “annual brain check-up” — and what may it look like? Under what conditions may specific brain training/ enhancement methods work? How can we best harness both human neuroplasticity and artificial intelligence (AI) to thrive in the 21st Century? Which companies, technologies and solutions are gaining the most traction so far, and what are some best practices for appropriate use?
The 2017 SharpBrains Virtual Summit (December 5-7th, 2017) will feature over thirty of the world’s top experts and innovators working on ways to enhance our brain health and performance in light of emerging neuroscience and digital technologies. Additionally, and for the first time, it will host a Brainnovations Pitch Contest to foster collaborative problem-solving between scientists, practitioners, technologists and entrepreneurs.
The Summit Agenda will explore in depth the 5 core themes discussed in the article Five reasons the future of brain enhancement is digital, pervasive and (hopefully) bright:
1. 7.5 billion human brains need help to thrive in the Digital Age
2. Lifelong neuroplasticity means all those brains can be enhanced
3. Mobile, sensing, wearable technologies, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI), provide a new platform to harness that neuroplasticity
4. Entrepreneurship and investments are fueling accelerated growth
5. Professionals are stepping up to help ensure appropriate use

What a brain, what a life: Marian Diamond, neuroplasticity pioneer, dies at 90
By: SharpBrains
___
Marian Diamond, neuroscientist who gave new meaning to ‘use it or lose it,’ dies at 90 (The Washington Post):
“Marian Diamond, a pathbreaking neuroscientist whose research — including a study of Albert Einstein’s preserved brain — showed that the body’s three-pound seat of consciousness was a dynamic structure of beautiful complexity, capable of development even in old age, died July 25 at an assisted-living community in Oakland, Calif. She was 90 Read the rest of this entry »

The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds Neurotechnology Hubs and innovative tools to advance research on Brain & Behavior
By: SharpBrains
  — Cornell University neuroscientist Chris Xu will study how brains produce behavior in species across a range of sizes.
NSF issues awards to advance a national research infrastructure for neuroscience (press release by the National Science Foundation):
“The National Science Foundation (NSF) has made 17 Next Generation Networks for Neuroscience (NeuroNex) awards to aid the research community as it pursues one of its grandest challenges: understanding the brain.
These projects will support the development of innovative, accessible and shared capabilities and resources, as well as theoretical frameworks and computational modeling to advance neuroscience research Read the rest of this entry »
