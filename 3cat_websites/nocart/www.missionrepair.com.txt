Thanks to Mission Repair for coming to my rescue again!

The first was over a month ago when I dropped my HTC Evo Shift and shattered the screen. Sprint wanted $600 for a new phone; the damage was too great to be fixed in house by them and the phone was without insurance. A referral from an iPhone carrying co-worker brought me to you and voila'! The phone was fixed!

Fast forward to three days ago when, upon sliding out my screen, it went dark. After bringing it back to Mission Repair, it was an easy fix and I wasn't charged for what turned out to be a cable adjustment!

Thanks so much and your business will come highly recommended if anyone else I know breaks anything! :-)
Thanks again, Denise


Hi, I normally don't give feedback unless I am extremely impressed. Well, I have to say that this has been the most pleasant experience EVER!

By my own stupidity, I cracked the screen on my iphone. I did a search on the internet and while there were MANY companies out there offering repair, I saw your site and did a little more research. I'm so glad I chose your company.

I sent my phone in on Monday and just received it in great working condition (today is Wednesday)!! You guys kept me informed of every little detail with the email updates. That is customer service! To be without my phone is a big sacrifice, so for you guys to fix it that quickly is amazing. I have many friends with iphones, so if their phone should ever meet the same fate mine did, you can bet I will definitely recommend Mission Repair!

Thanks so much!

A VERY happy customer,
Nancy L.
