Artist Spotlight
AudioTheme is perfect for artists, musicians, bands, record labels, and anyone that manages websites for independent music makers.
“It’s hard to find a theme designed specifically for musicians that aren’t over-the-top and instead have subtle and nuanced design elements. AudioTheme’s Promenade is beautiful and can take on the personality of our band while providing a powerful framework. It’s features work great out of the box, but can also integrate perfectly with custom builds.”
— Elephant Revival
“These themes fit PERFECTLY for the visuals of my new album, and my live band ... The music playlists, the navigation, the mobile friendly layout, the ease of use, ALL of it is just perfect for the web presence I wanted and will be happy with for many years to come.”
— Jeff Oster
“It just really fits. We feel it represents us. It’s simple but elegant at the same time. It’s really easy for our fans to navigate through and the possibility to play our music right there without the necessity of using external sources. And a very important reason; the mobile version works great and keeps it simple but beautiful.”
— Kapitol
