NOURISH YOUR PET THE WAY NATURE INTENDED
DISCOVER THE BENEFITS OF RAW
LIVING FOODS = THRIVING PETS
As passionate pet owners, we understand the care and concern that goes into choosing a source of nutrition for your companion. Our products make it easier than ever to keep your pet’s diet as close to nature as possible, allowing them to live longer, healthier, more vibrant lives.
SUPERIOR NUTRITION, UNLEASHED.
RAW
Pets experience better digestion and absorb nutrients more easily when fed a diet based on natural eating habits in the wild: muscle meat, meaty bones, organs, and raw fruits and vegetables.
RESPONSIBLY SOURCED
Free of antibiotics, steroids, preservatives and added hormones, all meat, poultry and game used in our products are responsibly sourced from sustainable ranchers in the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Europe.
HUMAN-GRADE
Simply put, the ingredients we use in our products are the same items you’d find in any health conscious human’s grocery cart — 100% USDA inspected proteins and fresh, certified organic fruits, vegetables, and non-synthetic vitamins and minerals.
SPECIES APPROPRIATE
When it comes to biology, cats and dogs are very different animals. Our products are formulated with each species’ unique biochemistry and metabolism in mind to deliver optimal portions of species appropriate nutrients.

TESTIMONIALS
Discover why so many pet owners are wild about Primal.
Our lab was 10 years old last year when we visited a new vet. ‘How old is she?’ he asked. ‘Ten months?’ Of course I said no, she was ten YEARS. He did a double-take then said again as he examined her ears, ‘She still looks like a pup.’ We owe her health to RAW FOOD!
