For some, the 2016 SCORE-International Baja 500 was the most demanding race they’ve ever been a part of. For Vildosola Racing, the extreme temperatures that plagued these racers was no match for the #21 Trophy Truck of Tavo Vildosola. In the scorching heat pushing nearly 120 degrees, Vildosola won his first career SCORE-International Baja 500, averaging a speed of 56.86 miles per hour, three minutes faster than Rob MacCachren, and finishing in eight hours, twenty minutes and fifty-five seconds.

King Shocks takes the overall win in the 47th SCORE Baja 500 with Apdaly Lopez. The win earns King Shocks its third straight overall victory in the SCORE International Off-Road Racing Series. The SCORE season kicked off with Tavo Vildosola taking the overall win at the San Felipe 250. The Baja Sur 500 saw Apdaly's RPM Racing and King Shocks teammate Lalo Laguna as the fastest overall driver on the 500-mile course. At the Bud Light SCORE Baja 500, it was Apdaly's turn to outrun the field in a 500-mile Baja torture test. You might have seen the young Lopez taking a gold medal at the X-games behind the wheel of his Formula Off-Road Stadium Super Truck in 2014. His X-games gold medal performance made him the youngest driver in X Games history to win a gold medal in a car or truck. He also became the first Mexican National to earn an X Games gold medal. Now he has a prestigious Baja 500 victory to add to his credentials.

  King Shocks launches the 2.5 Remote Reservoir Coilover Kit for 2010 + Toyota 4Runners with the KDSS sway bar system.

KDSS equipped vehicles have a different sway bar system than the standard models which requires a different reservoir location. We now have a kit for those who have a KDSS equipped 2010 + Toyota 4Runner. Same great kit as our current kit for standard 4Runners, but with a new reservoir location to accommodate the KDSS sway bar.
