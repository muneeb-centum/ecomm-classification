When the Mmmmaven Project opened I was excited that Boston had finally got it’s own DJ and production school. Now that I’ve spent time there (hanging out, playing the radio show and of course teaching a guest lecture) I have to say that the school is truly world class. With a progressive curriculum and awesome instructors I would recommend the Mmmmaven Project to anyone who wants to get into the magical world of electronic music.
